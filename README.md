# ReadFileProject
Read a file that checks the criteria for a password

1. Read a file that contains multiple sets of passwords(use www.theonegenerator.com/
to generate a set of test data).

2. Verify that the password contains all of the following criteria:

   1. A number
   2. A letter
   3. Special character (!@#)
   
3. Create three User Defined Exceptions for the corresponding criteria.

4. If the password does not meet the criteria, create and throw the appropriate
exception.
